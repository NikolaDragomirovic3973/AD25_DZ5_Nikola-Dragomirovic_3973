		<p class="p5">Darwin's father was dead set on his son becoming a cleric but even though the young rapscallion began to study theology he found worms much more interesting.</p>

		<p>Some say it was a load of birds from a bunch of islands hundreds of miles off the Ecuadorean coast that inspired his now widely accepted explanation of the mechanism of evolution. "Why does that bird on that island have a beak like that while that finch on that island has a beak like that? AHA! I've got it! Natural Selection!" he thought. It wasn't actually quite like that, but, y'know, it's a fine, popular romantic myth.</p>

		<h2 id="forth"> <i>The Origin</i> </h2>
		<p>Upon return from his jaunt, Charles chronicled his escapades (as <em>The Voyage of the Beagle</em>) and got a bit carried away with barnacles, although his theory of evolution was always ticking away in the back of his mind.</p>

    <h1 class="p4">After The Origin</h1>
    <div class="test" style="text-overflow:ellipsis;">Chuck D revised The Origin five times, toning down each one a bit more than the one before it, partly to appease his religious wife.
